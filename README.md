# @small-tech/https

A drop-in standard Node.js HTTPS module replacement with both automatic development-time (localhost) certificates via Auto Encrypt Localhost and automatic production certificates via Auto Encrypt.

Simply replace Node‚Äôs `https` module with `@small-tech/https` and get:

  - Automatically-provisioned TLS certificates at localhost with no browser warnings.
  - Automatically-provisioned TLS certificates at hostname via Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

That‚Äôs it.

This is basically a batteries-included version of the standard Node.js `https` module.

We exist in part thanks to patronage by people like you. If you share [our vision](https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology) and want to support our work, please [become a patron or donate to us](https://small-tech.org/fund-us) today and help us continue to exist.

## Audience

This is [small technology](https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology).

If you‚Äôre evaluating this for a ‚Äústartup‚Äù or an enterprise, let us save you some time: this is not the right tool for you. This tool is for individual developers to build personal web sites and apps for themselves and for others in a non-colonial manner that respects the human rights of the people who use them.

## Platform support

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL is not supported for certificates at localhost unless you‚Äôre running your browser under WSL also).

## Install

```sh
npm i @small-tech/https
```

## A note on Linux and the security farce that is ‚Äúprivileged ports‚Äù

Linux has an outdated feature dating from the mainframe days that requires a process that wants to bind to ports < 1024 to have elevated privileges. While this was a security feature in the days of dumb terminals, today it is a security anti-feature. (macOS has dropped this requirement as of macOS Mojave.)

On Linux, ensure your Node process has the right to bind to so-called ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù ports by issuing the following command before use:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(which node)
```

If you are wrapping your Node app into an executable binary using a module like [Nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe), you will have to ensure that every build of your app has that capability set. For an example of how we do this in [Site.js](https://sitejs.org), [see this listing](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/bin/lib/ensure.js#L124).

## Example

Here‚Äôs a basic Express ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù app that shows you how this module can be used. Note that you don‚Äôt need express to use it.

1. ### Set up:

    ```sh
    # Create the project folder and switch to it.
    mkdir example && cd example

    # Create a new npm module for the example.
    npm init --yes

    # Install dependencies.
    npm i @small-tech/https express

    # Open up the main file in your default editor.
    $EDITOR index.js
    ```

2. ### Code (index.js):

    ```javascript
    const https = require('..')

    // Helpers
    function html(message) {
      return `<!doctype html><html lang='en'><head><meta charset='utf-8'/><title>Hello, world!</title><style>body{background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif;}</style></head><body><h1>${message}</h1></body></html>`
    }
    const contentTypeHTML = {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}

    let options = {}

    // For globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates uncomment the following section.
    // To provision certificates, also remove ‚Äústaging: true‚Äù property.

    // const os = require('os')
    // options = {
    //   domains: [os.hostname()],
    //   staging: true
    // }

    // Create HTTPS server at https://localhost
    // with locally-trusted certificates.
    const server = https.createServer(options, (request, response) => {
      if (request.method !== 'GET') {
        response.writeHead(404, contentTypeHTML)
        response.end(html('Not found.'))
        return
      }
      // Respond to all routes with the same page.
      response.writeHead(200, contentTypeHTML)
      response.end(html('Hello, world!'))
    })

    server.listen(443, () => {
      console.log(' üéâ Server running on port 443.')
    })
    ```

3. ### Run:

    ```sh
    node index
    ```

Hit `https://localhost` and you should see your site with locally-trusted TLS certificates.

To provision globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates instead, uncomment the `options` object and pass it as the first argument in the `createServer()` method.

You can find a version of this example in the `/example` folder. To download and run that version:

```sh
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://source.small-tech.org/site.js/lib/https.git

# Switch to the directory.
cd https

# Install dependencies.
npm i

# Run the example.
npm run example
```
