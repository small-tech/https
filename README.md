# @small-tech/https

A drop-in standard Node.js HTTPS module replacement with both automatic development-time (localhost) certificates via Auto Encrypt Localhost and automatic production certificates via Auto Encrypt.

Simply replace Node‚Äôs `https` module with `@small-tech/https` and get:

  - Automatically-provisioned TLS certificates at localhost with no browser warnings via [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
  - Automatically-provisioned TLS certificates at hostname via [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
  - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS forwarding at hostname.

That‚Äôs it.

This is basically a batteries-included version of the standard Node.js `https` module.

___Note:__ This is a standard ECMAScript Modules (ESM; es6 modules) project. If you need to use legacy CommonJS, [please see the 2.x branch](https://github.com/small-tech/https/tree/2.x) which is currently still being maintained._

[Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org) is a tiny, independent not-for-profit.

We exist in part thanks to patronage by people like you. If you share [our vision](https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology) and want to support our work, please [become a patron or donate to us](https://small-tech.org/fund-us) today and help us continue to exist.

## Audience

This is [small technology](https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology).

If you‚Äôre evaluating this for a ‚Äústartup‚Äù or an enterprise, let us save you some time: this is not the right tool for you. This tool is for individual developers to build personal web sites and apps for themselves and for others in a non-colonial manner that respects the human rights of the people who use them.

## Platform support

Tested and supported on:

  - Linux (tested with elementary OS 5.x/Hera)
  - macOS (tested on Big Sur)
  - Windows 10 (tested in Windows Terminal with PowerShell)

(WSL is not supported for certificates at localhost unless you‚Äôre running your browser under WSL also).

## Install

```sh
npm i @small-tech/https
```

Note that during installation, this module‚Äôs Auto Encrypt Localhost dependency will download the correct mkcert binary to your machine.

## Examples

### At localhost with automatically-provisioned development certificates via mkcert.

```js
import https from '@small-tech/https'

const server = https.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.end('Hello, world!')
})

server.listen(443, () => {
  console.log(' üéâ Server running at https://localhost.')
})
```

Hit `https://localhost` and you should see your site with locally-trusted TLS certificates.

@small-tech/https uses mkcert to create a local certificate authority and add it to the various trust stores. It then uses it to create locally-trusted TLS certificates that are automatically used by your server.

### At hostname with automatically-provisioned Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates.

```js
import https from '@small-tech/https'
import os form 'os'

const hostname = os.hostname()
const options = { domains: [hostname] }

const server = https.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.end('Hello, world!')
})

server.listen(443, () => {
  console.log(` üéâ Server running at https://${hostname}.`)
})
```

To provision globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates, we additionally create an `options` object containing the domain(s) we want to support, and pass it as the first argument in the `createServer()` method.

@small-tech/https automatically provisions Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates for you the first time your server is hit (this first load will take longer than future ones). During this initial load, other requests are ignored. This module will also automatically renew your certificates as necessary in plenty of time before they expire.

You can find a version of this example in the `/example` folder. To download and run that version:

```sh
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://source.small-tech.org/site.js/lib/https.git

# Switch to the directory.
cd https

# Install dependencies.
npm i

# Run the example.
npm run example
```

## A note on Linux and the security farce that is ‚Äúprivileged ports‚Äù

Linux has an outdated feature dating from the mainframe days that requires a process that wants to bind to ports < 1024 to have elevated privileges. While this was a security feature in the days of dumb terminals, today it is a security anti-feature. (macOS has dropped this requirement as of macOS Mojave.)

On modern Linux systems, you can disable privileged ports like this:

```sh
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0
```

Or, if you want to cling to ancient historic relics like a conservative to a racist statue, ensure your Node process has the right to bind to so-called ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù ports by issuing the following command before use:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(which node)
```

If you are wrapping your Node app into an executable binary using a module like [Nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe), you will have to ensure that every build of your app has that capability set. For an example of how we do this in [Site.js](https://sitejs.org), [see this listing](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/bin/lib/ensure.js#L124).
